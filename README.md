# Optimization of Reaction Kinetics in Autocatalytic Batch Reactions

## Project Overview
This project focuses on optimizing reaction rate constants $k_1$ and $k_2$ for an autocatalytic isothermal batch reaction, maximizing the concentration $C_B$ over time. Using Python's SciPy library, this project models the differential equations governing the reactions and leverages optimization methods to identify values of $k_1$ and $k_2$ that achieve peak $C_B$ concentration.

## Background
The reaction under study is an autocatalytic batch reaction where the concentration changes over time according to:

$$
\frac{dC_A}{dt} = -k_1 C_A C_B
$$

$$
\frac{dC_B}{dt} = k_1 C_B C_A - k_2 C_B
$$

$$
\frac{dC_C}{dt} = k_2 C_B
$$

Given experimental concentration data, we aim to find optimal values for $k_1$ and $k_2$ to maximize $C_B$ and identify the time at which this maximum occurs.

## Objectives
- Model the system of ODEs describing reaction rates.
- Optimize rate constants $k_1$ and $k_2$ to maximize $C_B$.
- Validate the model with experimental data.

## Methodology
1. **Modeling Reaction Kinetics:** Using SciPy's ODE solver to represent the batch reaction system and simulate concentration changes over time.
2. **Optimization of Parameters:** Applying `scipy.optimize` to find the values of $k_1$ and $k_2$ that maximize $C_B$.
3. **Result Evaluation:** Analyze and visualize concentration trends, identifying peak $C_B$ values and times.
